# flutter-playground

Ask yourself: is it possible to create mobile hybrid apps easily? and do they look good? run fast? are cool & hip?

# current state of Flutter

Flutter has arrived 1.0 at Dec 2018

It looks like Google has made lot of right choices when developing Flutter.

- Flutter uses Dart as programming language
- Dart is statically typed, but feels familiar to javascript programmers 
- Dart compiles direclty to native and can be compiled incrementally allowing very fast development cycle  
- Ios & Android are supported out of box
- Integrations to Firebase are included

And combined with FireBase it all starts looking very bright.

- Firebase scales from simple use cases to very complex cloud environments 
- Firebase includes messaging, storage and authentication services 
- Added features for mobile incluce crashlytics

Development can be done within Andoid studio, but also other IDE's like Visual Studio Code are supported.

There are also interesting integrations also.

- Stripe has integrations to allow payment on mobile devices
- 2Dimensions has developed Flare to model vertor graphics, for which Flutter has player plugin

It's quite propable that there's more to come as platform matures.

# future Directions

Flutter should in future expand to other platforms as Android & iOs

One example is Web support, which is in experimental state (Dec 2018)

Other experimental efforts include support for developing Osx, Windows & Linux desktop applications

Flutter is also ported experimentally to Rasperry Pi, which allows Flutter apps to run without host opeting system on low capability environment

# installation

All installed components which flutter uses or needs eat up something like 3 - 4 gb disk, if not even more.

Intallation takes also some time (30 – 45 min, depending on internet & memory & processor)– so: be patient

Istall Flutter SDK (> 700 kb)
-	https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

Install Android Studio (> 1.6 gb)
-	https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor

Install android sdk + emulator + tools by opening android studio (> 2 gb)
-	https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos#set-up-the-android-emulator

add dart and flutter plugins to android studio 
-	https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor

Check installation with flutter doctor 
-	Flutter-doctor

Accept licences with flutter-doctor
-	flutter doctor --android-licenses

# first application

create new emptry project with Wizard from opening screen of Android Studio – try to open emulator – deploy your app there 

-	use scaffolding sample code
-	start emulator
-	run app

if you're lucky all works now
