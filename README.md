Ask yourself: is it possinle to create mobile hybrid apps easily? and do they look good? run fast? 

# current state of Flutter

Flutter has arrived 1.0 at Dec 2018

It looks like Google has made lot of right choices when developing Flatter.

- Flutter uses Dart as programming language
- Dart is statically typed, but feels familiar to javascript programmers 
- Dart compiles direclty to native and can be compiled incrementally allowing very fast development cycle  
- Ios & Android are supported out of box
- Integrations to Firebase are included

And combined with FireBase it all start looking very bright

- Firebase scales from simple use cases to very complex cloud environments 
- Firebase includes messaging, storage and authentication services 
- Added features for mobile incluce crashlytics

Development can be done within Andoid studio, but also other IDE's like Visual Studio Code are supported.

# future Directions

Flutter should in future expand to other platforms as Android & iOs

One example is Web support, which is in experimental state (Dec 2018)

Other experimental efforts include support for developing Osx, Windows & Linux desktop applications

Flutter is also ported experimentally to Rasperry Pi, which allows Flutter apps to run without host opeting system on low capability environment
